          How does it work? First, it pulls a list of posts from{" "}
          <a href={link.wsb} target="_blank">
            /r/wallstreetbets
          </a>{" "}
          based on filter selections.{" "}
          <a
            href={
              link.wsb + "/search/?q=flair%3ADD&restrict_sr=1&t=week&sort=top"
            }
            target="_blank"
          >
            Just like this.
          </a>{" "}
          Then, it does its best to parse the <i>primary ticker</i> and
          sentiment score for each post through some fancy-shmancy coding.
          (Don't see TSLA or PLTR on your top weekly DD post filters? Why tf is
          FROG on here? Idk, this thing isn't perfect)... Once all of the stonks
          have been scored and packaged, it drives off like an Amazon Prime
          delivery van on Christmas Eve to go fetch some price tags... The price
          tag for each post is NOT exact. It's whatever open/close price it's
          closest to. I need funds deposited in my bank account if we want
          minute-precision data. Anything that doesn't have a price gets
          removed. The rest of it is just some basic maths that any 3rd grader
          can do.{" "}

          Google AdSense on here, but they keep rejecting me because apparently
          this is "low-quality" content. I don't blame them. So, basically, I
          wasted two weekends putting this together for nothing. So sad. The
